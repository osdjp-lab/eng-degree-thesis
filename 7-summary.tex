\section{Summary}\label{Summary}

The initially stated goal was not reached in its entirety. However good progress was made on the path to achieving it. The choice of the C programming language as well the number of lines of code metric as criteria for package selection enabled the creation of a system relying on significantly less code than one built with the equivalent standard packages. However use of the cognitive complexity metric would have resulted in a more precise assessment had suitable solutions for its automated measurement been available. For many packages more concise alternatives were found. However not all could be replaced. An in depth analysis of the source code of the included standard packages, and a manual reduction of the feature set of each program was not possible due to lack of time. As such much still remains to be done. However optimistically the project at present can be considered the first step in the creation of a system and set of software geared towards linux learners.
