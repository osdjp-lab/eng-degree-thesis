\begin{itemize}
    \item Automated source code extraction of individual programs from packages.
    \item Automated evaluation of cognitive complexity metrics.
    \item Reimplementation of each package with the goal of minimal cognitive complexity.
    \item Extension of the system - addition of more programs and features in line with the initial goal.
    \item Evaluation of included programs and features in the context of the Unix philosophy in search of a modular minimal optimal subset of interoperable composable commands.
\end{itemize}
