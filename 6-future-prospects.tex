\begin{itemize}
    \item Current project:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Introduce reductions to the code base.
        \item Isolate the software build process.
        \item Make the system capable of self hosting.
        \item Extend the system via the addition of extra programs in line with the initial goal.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Derivative or supplementary projects:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Automate source code extraction of individual programs from packages.
        \item Automate evaluation of cognitive complexity metrics.
        \item Reimplement each package with the goal of minimal cognitive complexity.
        \item Evaluate included programs and features in context of the Unix philosophy in search of a modular minimal optimal subset of interoperable composable commands.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
