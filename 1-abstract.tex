\section{Abstract}\label{Abstract}
Contemporary Linux distributions tend to be overloaded with an abundance of software, making it increasingly difficult to master the fundamentals.
The goal of this thesis is to find a remedy to this situation by creation of a minimal Linux system implementation equipped with selected userland programs reduced to their indispensable functionality. The included software will be selected among available open source solutions and then reworked appropriately to meet the prescribed goal.
