\section{Evaluation}\label{Evaluation}

In order to evaluate the applicability of potential software packages, a set of delimiting factors as well as a procedure for consistently obtaining their values were chosen.

\subsection{Criteria}

The following source code properties were used as selection criteria:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \Gls{pil} - C programming language due to its:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item simplicity (small feature set).
        \item widespread use in software development.
        \item popularity in the programming communities.
        \item use in the Linux kernel and \glsxtrshort{libc}.
        \item use as a standard for \glsxtrshort{api} portability.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Number of \glsxtrfull{loc} metric from least to most due to its:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item availability.
        \item correlation with cognitive complexity.
        \item representation of project scope.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methodology}

The \gls{pil} and number of \glsxtrshort{loc} of each package were obtained via the tokei program \cite{tokei}.
