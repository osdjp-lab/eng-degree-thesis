\section{Code modification}\label{Code modification}

The majority of code/package modification carried out for the purposes of this project consisted of minor configuration changes needed to allow the packages to coexist/cooperate/interoperate within the system.

However for a few select packages more severe chanegs needed to be carried out this included pruning less relevent portions of the code base and along with it modifying the build system infrastructure.
