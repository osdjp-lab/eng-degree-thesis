\subsection{Features}\label{Features}

The programs provided by the \gls{lfl} system exhibit a smaller set of features than their standard equivalents.

\subsubsection{Compliant}

Programs originating from inherited standard packages as well as programs provided by mawk, dash, less, mandoc and sbase are \gls{lsb} compliant.

\begin{itemize}
    \item mawk - awk
    \item dash - sh
    \item less - less (more emulation)
    \item mandoc - man
    \item sbase - basename, cat, chgrp, chmod, chown, cksum, cmp, comm, cut, date, dd, dirname, du, echo, env, expand, expr, false, find, fold, grep, head, hostname, join, kill, ln, logger, logname, md5sum, mkdir, mkfifo, mknod, mktemp, nice, nl, nohup, paste, pathchk, printf, pwd, renice, rmdir, sed, seq, sleep, sort, split, strings, sync, tail, tee, test / [, time, touch, tr, true, tsort, tty, uname, unexpand, uniq, wc
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Non-compliant}

The programs provided by ubase as well as a subset of programs provided by sbase are non-compliant with the \gls{lsb} specification. These implementations are missing certain features (listed or described in parentheses), nontheless they exhibit a high degree of compatability with standard implementations.

\begin{itemize}
    \item ubase - dd (ibs, obs and cbs), df (-Pt), dmesg (-s), id (-r), killall5 (-egilqVv), mknod (-p), mount (-FfLrsUVvw), passwd (-xnwilu), pidof (-x), ps (-GglnoptUu), su (-cmS), umount (-rtVv)
    \item sbase - cp (-i), ed (g and v operate on single commands, e, E, r, w and W commands cannot accept shell escapes), getconf (-v), ls (-Ckmpsx), install (-bpSsv), mv (-i), od (-v always enabled, 'd' interpreted as 'u' when given as parameter for -t flag), rm (-i), tar (flag based instead of key based option selection), xargs (-p)
\end{itemize}
