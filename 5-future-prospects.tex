\begin{itemize}
    \item Creation of a program for automated source code extraction of individual programs from program packages.
    \item Creation of a program for the automated evaluation of cognitive complexity metrics.
    \item Reimplementation of each package with the goal of minimal cognitive complexity.
    \item Extension of the system - addition of more programs and features in line with the initial goal.
    \item Evaluation of included programs and features in the context of the Unix philosophy in search of a minimal optimal subset of interoperable composable commands.
\end{itemize}
