\section{Evaluation}\label{Evaluation}

\subsection{Criteria}

The following source code properties were chosen for the selection of packages:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Primary implementation language - C programming language due to its:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item simplicity.
        \item widespread use in software development.
        \item popularity in the programming communities.
        \item use in the Linux kernel and Libc.
        \item standard for API portability.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Number of lines of code (LOC) metric from least to most due to its:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item availability.
        \item correlation with cognitive complexity.
        \item representation of project scope.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methodology}

The primary implementation language and number of lines of code of each package were obtained via the tokei program \cite{tokei}.
