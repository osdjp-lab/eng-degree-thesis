\section{Composition}\label{Composition}

Initially a set of standard packages required by \gls{lsb} Core was selected as shown in table \ref{table:LSB Core standard packages}. A number of these were determined to be out of scope and were thus excluded. For the majority of the remaining packages smaller alternatives were found and evaluated in accordance with the selection criteria. The rest were inherited. Finally packages not specified by \gls{lsb} Core, but required for the creation of the system, including the bootloader, kernel and init were added. Beyond that a C compiler was also included for the purpose of demonstrating local software build functionality.
