\section{Composition}\label{Composition}

Initially a set of standard packages required by \gls{lsb} Core was selected as shown in table \ref{table:LSB Core standard packages}. A number of these were determined to be out of scope and were thus excluded. For the majority of the remaining packages smaller alternatives were found and evaluated in accordance with the selection criteria. The rest were inherited. Next packages not specified by \gls{lsb} Core, but required for the creation and installation of the system, including the bootloader, kernel, partition manager and init were added. Finally a C compiler was also included for the purpose of demonstrating local software build functionality. All software built for the system is statically linked.
